# perceptron-c
This is a multilayer perceptron designed for learning the XOR dataset built in the glorious C programming
language made by the beautiful Dennis Ritchie.

# What it does rn
- Initializes a neural network with random weights and biases (mlp struct).
- Runs forward propagation on an arbitrary array using sigmoid for both the hidden and output 
layer.

# Need to do
- Dataset handling for XOR.
- Implement backpropagation.
  - Loss will be binary cross entropy.
- Later: 
  - Xavier for weight and bias initialization.
  - Extend the MLP into learning regression and multi-class problems.
